IGNORE THE NAME FOR THE STHS34PF80 REPO. I DONT WANNA MOVE FILES AROUND JUST TO RENAME IT, IMAGINE IT SAYS STM32F446RE


Steps:


Sensors pick up raw analog signals

Stores these analog signals onto a communication chip

Chip sends signals over to the Microcontroller

Microcontroller puts data through an algorithm to determine buzzer strength


Tech:


Microcontroller - STM32F446RE NUCLEO

Sensors - 2x STHS34PF80, and an Arduino Ultrasonic Sensor

Coding Languages - C/C++
